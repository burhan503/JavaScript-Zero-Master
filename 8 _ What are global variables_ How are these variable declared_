Q : What are global variables? How are these variable declared?
Answer :

A JavaScript global variable is declared outside the function or declared with window object. It can be accessed from any function.
When you declare a variable outside the function, it is added in the window object internally. You can access it through window object also

The var keyword is used to declare a local variable or object.
If the var keyword is omitted, a global variable is declared.

Declaration example
var value=50;  
function a(){  
alert(window.value);//accessing global variable  
}
