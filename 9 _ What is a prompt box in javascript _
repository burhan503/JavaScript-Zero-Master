Q : What is a prompt box in JavaScript ?
Answer :
A prompt box is a box that allows the user to enter input by providing a text box.
A label and box will be provided to enter the text or number.

A prompt box is often used if you want the user to input a value before entering a page.

When a prompt box pops up, the user will have to click either "OK" or "Cancel" to proceed after entering an input value.

If the user clicks "OK" the box returns the input value. If the user clicks "Cancel" the box returns null.
