Q :  What is for-in loop in Javascript?
A : The for-in loop is used to loop through the properties of an object.

The syntax for the for-in loop is â€“

for (variable name in object){
    statement or block to execute
}
In each repetition, one property from the object is associated with the variable name.
 The loop is continued till all the properties of the object are depleted.
