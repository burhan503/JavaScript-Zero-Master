Q : What is the working of timers in JavaScript ?
Answer :

A timer is used to execute some task after a particular time interval.
Basically, with the help of a timer in JavaScript, we can delay the code execution.
With the help of the timer function in JavaScript,
we can achieve asynchronous functionality also.

Suppose we are delaying the execution of some function with the help of timer function,
then that function will not get executed when the JavaScript engine will encounter it.
It would be stored somewhere else and when the timer expired then that function would be executed.

setTimeout(()=>{
console.log("Exucute it later..")
},1000)
console.log("Execute in first...")

output

Execute in first...
Exucute it later..


SetIntervel : The setInterval() method calls a function at specified intervals.

The setInterval() method continues calling the function until clearInterval() is called, or the window is closed.

The setInterval() function is commonly used to set a delay for functions that are executed again and again, such as animations.
we can cancel the interval using clearInterval().
